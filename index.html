                                <p>Orenda teaches coaches how to work with their clients on developing skills to manage their symptoms. This approach is distinctive from psychotherapy in that there is no engagement with the trauma story. Coaches support their clients in getting stronger, in managing their symptoms, and in working towards becoming their best selves.

                                <p>Orenda Coaches focus on the here and now. Survivors will work with their coaches either as an addition to psychotherapy or on its own in effort to build on strengths of the survivor while working towards goals. Orenda coaches work with their clients assuming goodness and capacity in all people while building on the unique characteristics of each client.

                                <p>My career in behavioral health began in 1995, where I began working with developmentally disabled children and adults. My faith in human capacity and resilience is rooted in this experience; the people I was hired to serve were my teachers. The foundation of my current
                                    orientation to trauma was developed in what they taught me, which is essentially to approach work with people from the assumption of capacity, inherent goodness and strength. Working with this population prompted me to pursue my Bachelors degree in Social Work, which I completed at Pacific University. I graduated Magna Cum Laude and completed my Masters in Social Work from Portland State University. Here I was the recipient of the Laurels Scholarship and graduated Magna Cum Laude. I am currently enrolled in a doctoral program in pursuit of my PsyD, or doctorate of psychology.

                        <p>Creating a Trauma Coaching curriculum has been a goal for many years in recognition of the severe gaps in care alongside the need for higher levels of support for survivors of trauma. Many mental health clinicians are at capacity and are unable to meet the overwhelming demand. Additionally, developing skill sets to manage symptoms as well as having someone to rely on between therapy sessions would clearly help people progress more efficiently and less painfully.  Trauma Coaches can fill this gap.  This course is an accumulation of my life’s work and is an effort to increase accessibility informed support for survivors of trauma on a global scale.

                                <p>I didn’t design this course to be something you take once and never come back to. I created it as a resource you can come back to over and over again as you develop skills. That said, to get the certification expect to commit approximately 5-7 hours of work per week, which would take approximately 20 weeks to complete. You are able to set your own pace and complete the training at a slower pace if you need to. 
                                    We understand that life can get in the way of the live courses. If you miss one, you will be able to make it up by taking that particular course at a later date as the live courses are structured and are offered repeatedly throughout the year.

                                <p>As a coach, it will be up to you to be clear with your clients what differentiates coaching from therapy. 
                                    As a trauma coach, you will help your clients build the skills they need in order to prepare themselves to address their past trauma, to help support them as they work through it, or to help them work towards being their best selves after recovering. 
                                    Therapy is a highly contained and controlled environment that allows practitioners who are trained in modalities specifically designed to treat the symptoms of post-traumatic stress to do so safely and successfully. A key feature of therapy is addressing trauma directly, whereas coaches limit their scope to skill building, offering support between therapy sessions, and working towards thriving with trauma in the rear view mirror. Therapy can involve processing the past, while coaching is focused on the present and the future.

                                <p>Yes, with the exception of the in-person, retreat style trainings. You will be able to complete your courses completely online with only five live courses required prior to receiving your certification. You will have the flexibility to miss live classes and make them up later, as they are structured classes offered on a rotating basis. The live classes are tied to specific skills that are presented to you throughout the course and are an opportunity to practice.
